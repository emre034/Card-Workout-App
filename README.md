Uploading for my master application.

In our collaborative project, Mehmet Uğur Karadağ led as the project manager and full-stack developer. He was responsible for the comprehensive development and management of the project. My contribution was more focused, aiding in specific areas like design and user interface, to complement Mehmet Uğur Karadağ's broader development responsibilities.

This project is a straightforward workout app that uses a virtual deck of cards to suggest random exercises. It aims to make exercise routines more dynamic and engaging. I was involved in the design process of the app, focusing on the user interface to make it intuitive and appealing. My role did not involve coding but rather the aesthetic and functional aspects of the app's design.
